                         <h2>Its time to take back what's yours</h2>
                         <h4>What are they taking from you?</h4>
                         <p>
                              Everyone always speaks about there right to freedom of speak but no one speaks about their right To Life ,Liberty 
                              and personal security.article 23 .3 of the Universal Human Rights says "  Everyone who works has the right to fair 
                              and satisfactory remuneration, which secures him and his family an existence commensurate with human dignity, if 
                              necessary supplemented by other social protection measures."  Thats huge and probably hard to achieve in our country 
                              but its our right. We all have the right to Financial Freedom.
                         </p>
                         <h4>What is Financial Freedom?</h4>
                         <p>
                              At its most basic definition Financial Freedom means being able to cover all your basic needs with out the need to depend on another human being or an institution. Meaning when you work for a full calender month your remuneration should last you until you get paid again while still covering all your basic Human needs.  
                         </p>
                         <h4>Do I have Financial Freedom?</h4>
                         <p>
                              While financial freedom may mean different things to different people, eeling a sense of financial stability is a commonly listed components of this coveted liberty. The reality, however, is that most South Africans will never experience any of these comforts. Research shows that 60% of the nation is unable to afford an emergency expense of R20 000, and only 6% can retire comfortably one day.The financial services industry has a responsibility to educate and inform clients and the broader public. “It is important to remember that most South Africans are taking care of people other than themselves. The sandwich generation, which refers to individuals in their 40s and 50s who not only have to look after their children, but also take care of their elderly parents, is particularly relevant.” Everyone has to make the most of the money that they have.Although it is a privilege to be able to help your family and even extended family financially it is also a reality for a lot of economically active young people that the money they earn is not their own. “When starting out on their financial journey, on the income ladder, the personal financial planning of these young people is more complicated, and as a result they cannot immediately start saving or investing in their own future.”There are positive legacies in the country as well “Informal savings activities, like stokvels, can be very lucrative when managed correctly, and individuals who take part in these mostly spend their ‘pay-outs’ well. The problem, in terms of reaching financial freedom, is that informal stokvels are typically short-term and do not get invested formally to gain interest. This often means that they do not reap the rewards of a long–term investing strategy that is geared for a specific goal or outcome. Informal savings vehicles are not regulated and the participants miss out on the benefits they would have gained from the formal economy like earning interest, dividends or being able to take out loans against their investments and growing their personal wealth that way,

                         <h4>Can Debt Review Help you achieve Financial Freedom?</h4>
                         <p>
                              It would have been possible to answer that question with a simple NO !!!!1 but to just go more in depth, Quite possibly it could in the long run atleast.... but debt review would be the opposite of financial freedom because you are prohibited from making a choice on whether or not you should incure further credit agreements, SO NO it wont.
