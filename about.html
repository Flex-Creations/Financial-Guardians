                              <p><span>Kashief & Zaynoneesa Davids</span>, born in the  Cape Flats, neither was 
                                   brought up from a state of privilege. However, their hearts minds and dreams 
                                   were never going to be held back by their circumstances. Zaynoneesa is still 
                                   new in the credit management sector but her background as a legal assistant 
                                   is a huge benefit to <span>Financial Guardians</span> as will her humanitarian 
                                   side. Kashief on the other hand is an industry veteran, having worked at multiple 
                                   companies holding various positions up to that of Regional manager. His ability 
                                   to make sales was never doubted but while at the big companies he would have to 
                                   do as the romans do... that was until he was fired on the 26th March 2020.</p>
                         </div>

                    <div class="founding animate fadeInLeft">
                         <p>
                              No one could have thought that when he was unfairly dismissed the day before an unprecedented 
                              national lockdown that it would be a blessing for not only him but for so many consumers out 
                              there. On the days leading up to when i was fired, I remember a conversation I had with the 
                              owner. I was proposing to have a client removed from debt review without having to go to 
                              call seeing that his debt was paid in full. This would have been R3000 cheaper and would have 
                              been 20 times faster, instead the owner responded to me by saying we do things the SABSA PROMED 
                              way, which meant clients never got removed. So when I got fired the first person I called was 
                              Martin Coetzee, it took us about six weeks to get Martin off debt review. Martin was so happy 
                              he wanted to buy a plane ticket to come thank me in person but I said no it's not necessary 
                              because right then I knew that I have been blessed by God to give such joy to people. I remember 
                              when my mother was scammed and how it frustrated her and how she yearned for her freedom but was 
                              too scared to get it. I don't want anybody else to have that fear because <span>Financial Guardians</span> is 
                              here to be of service.

                         <h4>Why Us?</h4>
                         <p>
                              A common misconception is that a small companies are inferior and less competent than the big 
                              corporate companies. There is also an accepted belief that smaller companies are more likely 
                              to scam or con you. These are utter and total lies. The bigger companies are in most instances 
                              only as big because of there financial and economic status. There magnitude is built up on the 
                              marketing strategies which are funded by 10s or even 100s of thousands of rands. Do they have your 
                              interest at heart? I would not think so...... 
                              <br><br>
                              Now <span>FINANCIAL GUARDIANS</span> on the other hand, our magnitude is solely thanks to the word of mouth 
                              marketing we recieve from our happy clients. Now you might not think that our stats are much but when 
                              you consider how long ago we started and the situation we found ourselves in when we started... 
                              I promise you, we have grown exponentially. Now other people will use fancy words some and will lie to 
                              you about their registrations etc. We though have a 100% transparency belief and yes, our company is CIPC 
                              registered, we are Tax compliant as well as BEE certified. When it comes to NCR registration at the moment... 
                              no, we are not, <span>HOWEVER</span> of our services are carried out by our affilliates whom indeed do have full 
                              accreditation and registration with the NCR. One of them is Mauritz Van Den Heever, the director at Leocorp 
                              and senior member of DCASA ( Debt counsellors association of South Africa).  In conclusion, we can gladly 
                              say, You are in <span>GOOD HANDS.</span>

                              Do you have an hour? Because to fully understand our aim, you need to go as far back as the apartheid era but 
                              We will summarise it for you and try make it as modernized as possible. Among all our goals there are 2, who 
                              takes preference over the others: 
                              <br><br>
                              1.) Is that we want consumers to recieve the service which they are promised at the very least but we will strive 
                              to give deliver this service in shorter time frame than we promised in a more proffessional manner than expected 
                              and at a more pocket pleasing fee or fee structure. 

                              <br><br>
                              2.) The people whom are doing the Marketing and sales will be rewarded should they uphold the customer service 
                              standards expected. We shall do this by remunerating them adequately training them and making them self 
                              sufficcient them and where need be be accomiodating to there needs.

                    <h4>What are they taking from you?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Everyone always speaks about there right to freedom of speak but no one speaks about their right To Life ,Liberty 
                         and personal security.article 23 .3 of the Universal Human Rights says "  Everyone who works has the right to fair 
                         and satisfactory remuneration, which secures him and his family an existence commensurate with human dignity, if 
                         necessary supplemented by other social protection measures."  Thats huge and probably hard to achieve in our country 
                         but its our right. We all have the right to Financial Freedom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What is Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         At its most basic definition Financial Freedom means being able to cover all your basic needs with out the need to depend on another human being or an institution. Meaning when you work for a full calender month your remuneration should last you until you get paid again while still covering all your basic Human needs.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Do I have Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         While financial freedom may mean different things to different people, eeling a sense of financial stability is a commonly listed components of this coveted liberty. The reality, however, is that most South Africans will never experience any of these comforts. Research shows that 60% of the nation is unable to afford an emergency expense of R20 000, and only 6% can retire comfortably one day.The financial services industry has a responsibility to educate and inform clients and the broader public. “It is important to remember that most South Africans are taking care of people other than themselves. The sandwich generation, which refers to individuals in their 40s and 50s who not only have to look after their children, but also take care of their elderly parents, is particularly relevant.” Everyone has to make the most of the money that they have.Although it is a privilege to be able to help your family and even extended family financially it is also a reality for a lot of economically active young people that the money they earn is not their own. “When starting out on their financial journey, on the income ladder, the personal financial planning of these young people is more complicated, and as a result they cannot immediately start saving or investing in their own future.”There are positive legacies in the country as well “Informal savings activities, like stokvels, can be very lucrative when managed correctly, and individuals who take part in these mostly spend their ‘pay-outs’ well. The problem, in terms of reaching financial freedom, is that informal stokvels are typically short-term and do not get invested formally to gain interest. This often means that they do not reap the rewards of a long–term investing strategy that is geared for a specific goal or outcome. Informal savings vehicles are not regulated and the participants miss out on the benefits they would have gained from the formal economy like earning interest, dividends or being able to take out loans against their investments and growing their personal wealth that way,

                    <h4>Can Debt Review Help you achieve Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         It would have been possible to answer that question with a simple NO !!!!1 but to just go more in depth, Quite possibly it could in the long run atleast.... but debt review would be the opposite of financial freedom because you are prohibited from making a choice on whether or not you should incure further credit agreements, SO NO it wont.
