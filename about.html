                         </p>

                         <h5>How did we start</h5>
                         <p>
                              Born in the Cape Flats, no silver spoon, barely a wooden one. However, our hearts 
                              minds and dreams were never going to be held back by their circumstances.
                              <br>
                              <span>Founder</span>: Kashief is an industry veteran, 
                              having worked at multiple companies holding various positions up to that of Regional 
                              manager. His ability to make sales was never doubted, Being with out fail the top 
                              sales person everywhere he went. While at all these companies He learnt that the 
                              core values within these companies were Manipulation, Greed and exploitation, He 
                              left the industry which he had been in for 7 years in 2019 but then in February 
                              2020 he was persuaded by a Locally based debt management comany to return home. 
                              26 March 2020 though the Prodigal's son was fired, This firing was to be the spark 
                              that lit the flame we now call <span> FINANCIAL GUARDIANS</span>.
                              <br>
                              <span>Admin Hr Manager</span>: Zaynoneesa is still new in the credit management sector but her 
                              background as a legal assistant is a huge benefit to Financial Guardians as will her 
                              humanitarian side. A young intllegent lady for whom articulation and people skills 
                              were always of second nature she left her job during Lock down when she saw The 
                              drive desire and impact which the founder of Financial Guardians  had. 
                              <br>
                              <span>Customer Relations Officer</span>: Now this is someone who came from a totally different 
                              industry and knew less than nothing but quickly absorbed what he was taughtand 
                              implemented his on style and uniqueness to the brand. Still getting to learn ins 
                              and outs but already great asset to have. 
                              <br><br>
                              <span>Kashief Davids - Being fired was the greatest blessing God ever gave me.</span>
                              <br><br>
                              No one could have thought that when he was unfairly dismissed the day before an unprecedented national lockdown that it would be a blessing for not only him but for so many consumers out there. On the days leading up to when i was fired, during a conversation with the owner. Kashief was proposing to have a client removed from debt review without having to go to court seeing that his debt was paid in full. This would have been R3000 cheaper and would have been 20 times faster, instead the owner responded to me by saying we do things the SABSA PROMED way, which meant clients never got removed. So when he got fired the first person he called was Martin Coetzee, it took about six weeks to get Martin off debt review. Martin was so happy he wanted to buy a plane ticket to come thank Kashief  in person but it was lockdown and Kashief thought that would be unneccesary nut he also felt right then and there  that he had been blessed by God to give such joy to people. Remembering the voices of those whom shared with him there stories about being scammed or exploited, <span>PICTURING HIS OWN MOTHER</span>, whom he remembered yearned for her freedom but was too scared to get it. He said to himself, no one else needs to have that fear any longer because <span>FINANCIAL GUARDIANS</span> are here to be of service.

                         <p>
                              A common misconception is that a small companies are inferior and less competent than the big corporate companies. There is also an accepted belief that smaller companies are more likely to scam or con you. These are utter and total lies. The bigger companies are in most instances only as big as they are because of there financial and economic status. There magnitude is built up on the marketing strategies which are funded by 10s or even 100s of thousands of rands. Do they have your interest at heart? I would not think so...
                              <br><br>
                              Now <span>FINANCIAL GUARDIANS</span> on the other hand, our magnitude is solely thanks to the word of mouth marketing we recieve from our happy clients. Now you might not think that our stats are much but when you consider how long ago we started and the situation we found ourselves in when we started... I promise you, we have grown exponentially. Now other people will use fancy words some and will lie to you about their registrations etc. We though have a 100% transparency belief and Go ahead ask us anything we will gladly oblidge

                    <h4>Am I Blacklisted?</h4>
                    <p>
                         The answer to this is NO !!!! Blacklisted was done away with in 2012. It refers to a time that the Credit burae’s only kept negative information so if your name  was there it mean you wont be given debt meaning you blacklisted but this was abolished in 2012. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why would people speak about Blacklisting?</h4>
                    <p>
                         One of 2 reasons either they wish to scare you into paying your accounts or they wish to sell you a service which dont exist.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What are they taking from you?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Everyone always speaks about there right to freedom of speak but no one speaks about their right To Life ,Liberty and personal security.article 23 .3 of the Universal Human Rights says " Everyone who works has the right to fair and satisfactory remuneration, which secures him and his family an existence commensurate with human dignity, if necessary supplemented by other social protection measures." Thats huge and probably hard to achieve in our country but its our right. We all have the right to Financial Freedom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What is Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         At its most basic definition Financial Freedom means being able to cover all your basic needs with out the need to depend on another human being or an institution. Meaning when you work for a full calender month your remuneration should last you until you get paid again while still covering all your basic Human needs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Do I have Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         While financial freedom may mean different things to different people, eeling a sense of financial stability is a commonly listed components of this coveted liberty. The reality, however, is that most South Africans will never experience any of these comforts. Research shows that 60% of the nation is unable to afford an emergency expense of R20 000, and only 6% can retire comfortably one day.The financial services industry has a responsibility to educate and inform clients and the broader public. “It is important to remember that most South Africans are taking care of people other than themselves. The sandwich generation, which refers to individuals in their 40s and 50s who not only have to look after their children, but also take care of their elderly parents, is particularly relevant.” Everyone has to make the most of the money that they have.Although it is a privilege to be able to help your family and even extended family financially it is also a reality for a lot of economically active young people that the money they earn is not their own. “When starting out on their financial journey, on the income ladder, the personal financial planning of these young people is more complicated, and as a result they cannot immediately start saving or investing in their own future.”There are positive legacies in the country as well “Informal savings activities, like stokvels, can be very lucrative when managed correctly, and individuals who take part in these mostly spend their ‘pay-outs’ well. The problem, in terms of reaching financial freedom, is that informal stokvels are typically short-term and do not get invested formally to gain interest. This often means that they do not reap the rewards of a long–term investing strategy that is geared for a specific goal or outcome. Informal savings vehicles are not regulated and the participants miss out on the benefits they would have gained from the formal economy like earning interest, dividends or being able to take out loans against their investments and growing their personal wealth that way
                    </p>
                    <h4>Can Debt Review Help you achieve Financial Freedom?</h4>
                    <p>
                         It would have been possible to answer that question with a simple NO !!!!1 but to just go more in depth, Quite possibly it could in the long run atleast.... but debt review would be the opposite of financial freedom because you are prohibited from making a choice on whether or not you should incure further credit agreements, SO NO it wont.
